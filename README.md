Mini-project that involves deconstructing a website page and rebuilding it. Gaining a better understanding of webpage structure and placement will be gained from this exercise. I am very excited to continue my coding learning. 
Initally the hardest parts of the excercise involved the top navigation bar placement and the bottom footer bar placement. Understanding CSS padding and classes definitely helped. 
Also another important thing is linking the CSS style sheet to the html file. The browser will not recognize the style settings unless it is linked to the html page. 
All in all it was fun figuring out the placement of things. 
Learned alot more about html functions and css styling.
